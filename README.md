# RenderCV Pipeline

Are you ready to revolutionize the way you manage and craft your CVs and resumes?

Picture this:

1.  You simply update your `src/John_Doe_CV.yaml` input file and push the changes.
2.  Then, a pipeline generates a new PDF and Markdown from it and uploads it to the repository.
3.  When you are done with your work, you can create a new release on GitHub, tagging your CV with something like `v2024.04`. The pipeline will automatically add the PDF and its $\LaTeX$ source as assets to the release.
4.  You have successfully created your CV pipeline, and all the history is in safe hands and reproducible.

**How to start?**

1.  [Click here](https://github.com/new?template_name=rendercv-pipeline&template_owner=sinaatalay) to create your CV repository based on this `rendercv-pipeline` template repository.
2.  Edit either
    -  the `src/John_Doe_CV.yaml` file, or
    -  the contents of `src/markdown` or `src/classic` directories
    
    and push. Then, see the magic happen.

**Some tips**

-  Learn more about [RenderCV](https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv) to understand what you can do with this tool.
-  Edit and preview your CV in your browser without installing anything by creating a codespace. Click the <> **Code** button, then click the **Codespaces** tab, and then click **Create codespace on main**. The environment will be ready for RenderCV usage. Update `.vscode/launch.json` to point to your YAML file and press `F5` to run RenderCV in the browser.

# Welcome to RenderCV!

[RenderCV](https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv) is a LaTeX-based CV/resume framework. It allows you to create a high-quality CV or resume as a PDF file from a YAML file, with **full Markdown syntax support** and **complete control over the LaTeX code**.

The boilerplate content was inspired by [Gayle McDowell](https://github.com/dnl-blkv/mcdowell-cv).

# Quick Guide

- Each section title is arbitrary and each section contains a list of entries.
- There are 7 unique entry types: *BulletEntry*, *TextEntry*, *EducationEntry*, *ExperienceEntry*, *NormalEntry*, *PublicationEntry*, and *OneLineEntry*.
- Select a section title, pick an entry type, and start writing your section!
