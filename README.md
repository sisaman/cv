# Welcome to RenderCV!

[RenderCV](https://rendercv.com) is a LaTeX-based CV/resume version-control and maintenance app. It allows you to create a high-quality CV or resume as a PDF file from a YAML file, with **Markdown syntax support** and **complete control over the LaTeX code**.

The boilerplate content was inspired by [Gayle McDowell](https://github.com/dnl-blkv/mcdowell-cv).
